The task is to choose a proper Design Pattern and to think about the problem to solve with it.

I decided to solve problem of creating two differnet cars with different parameters of Body, Suspension, Foundation and Interior.

Here we have to cars: BMW and VAZ. For BMW it was decided to make suspension - Multi-Link, interioir - Comfortable, foundation - Strong, body - Awesome. 
For VAZ these parameters are: suspension - Spring, interioir - Uncomfortable, foundation - Strong, body - Poor. 
It can not be the same as yours, it's just a fantasy of the Author.

I used Template Method as a design pattern.
